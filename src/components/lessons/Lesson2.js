			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Terms & Conditions define the relationship between the
					service provider (app, website) and the user (you). This
					includes things like what features the service provides, and
					how it handles misuse. It is a legal agreement.
				</li>
				<li>
					Privacy Policy defines how the company who created the
					service handles user data.
				</li>
				<li>
					There is a lot more data about you on the internet than you
					think. It is not limited to usernames and photos; sites
					often track which links you click, what your friends say
					about you etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					Privacy Policy is ambigious, although typically informs you
					whether your data is shared with third parties.
				</li>
				<li>
					Protecting your privacy is important because there is so
					much of it, and it can be either "sold" to advertisers, or
					make you easily identifiable.

				Before we begin the video, please sign up using the link below.
				It is extremely important that you do so right at this moment,
				so pause the video, go visit the link, and come back to this
				video. Pause it and come back.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ok, I’m going to assume you’re back! If you didn’t sign up using
				the form, good for you. If you did indeed input your email
				address there — chances are, you’ve agreed with the Privacy
				Policy but haven’t actually read it.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you’ve read the rules, you would have spotted that you’ve
				just granted the right for me to share your email address to the
				most annoying newsletters in the world. Your tick counts as a
				signature on a legally binding document.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, I won’t share your email address with anyone, the webpage
				is just a mockup and there is no way for me to know what email
				address you’ve entered. But let’s examine closer what Privacy
				Policy and Terms and Conditions are.
			</p>
			<p>
				Typically, you’ll see two types of documents when you sign up to
				a new service or an app.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of them is Terms and Conditions, or Terms of Service, T&Cs,
				or any other terms. This document provides an outline of what
				the app or the website is, what it does, what features it has.
				Terms of Use define what the relationship is between you as a
				user, and the Company who has built the website.
			</p>
			<p>
				Companies need to have Terms and Conditions in order to protect
				themselves against abusers in court, for example. So that if
				someone uses their service for something it’s not intended to,
				the company can say, hey, what this user did is against our
				rules.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, there is another document — Privacy Policy. That’s the one
				where it gets really interesting.
			</p>
			<p>
				Privacy Policy is all about how that company manages data — what
				they collect about you, what they store, how data is kept safe,
				and how it’s used to sell you stuff. This includes your personal
				data. Name, password, email — whatever you entered to sign up.
				But wait. There’s more.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reading through Instagram's Privacy Policy, you can probably
				already name a bunch of reasons why this is problematic.
			</p>
			<p>
				For one, when you signed up for Instagram, TikTok, the course
				registration form, you probably didn’t read what data the
				company is collecting. Sure, maybe you would have bitten the
				bullet and accepted the policy, but at least you would feel like
				you know what you’re signing up for, right?
			</p>
			<p>
				Two — there is a lot more data about you than you think. When
				you’re signing up for something, you think you are only giving
				them exactly what’s asked of you — name, email address etc. but
				that’s just the tip of the iceberg, as we’ve just seen with
				Instagram. Location data, what sites you visit, whose profile
				you’re checking, even what your friends say about you, that may
				all be recorded.
			</p>
			<p>
				Something that online shops do to increase their sales for
				example, is track where the user is placing their cursor when
				they’re browsing the store and create deals and discounts
				specifically for that user based on that.
			</p>
			<p>
				And then lastly, we rarely know how the information you are
				sharing is used, and who it’s shared with. You may think, okay,
				sure I’m giving away a lot, but if it’s just Instagram who knows
				who I am, then it’s not so bad? Well, it’s not quite what
				happens. Oftentimes, all this additional data, called meta-data,
				will be shared with advertisers who want people just like you to
				buy things from them, or influence your opinion. Meta-data can
				include things like what time of the day you look at the app,
				which posts you stop for a few seconds to look at, what types of
				accounts you search for, or how often you check who watches your
				stories.
			</p>
			<p>Privacy Policy statements are also vague.</p>
			<p>
				Instagram's Privacy Statement says:{" "}
				<i>
					“We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we
					never will.”
				</i>
				But then in the next page —{" "}
				<i>
					“We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of
					people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing,
					but we don't share information that personally identifies
					you (information such as your name or email address that by
					itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are)
					unless you give us permission.”
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				So location data, does that identify you? What if the advertiser
				wants to target everyone living in your area, who is your age,
				goes to a particular set of schools? Is that not, in a way, your
				data? To be clear, the advertisers pay to have access to that
				group of people, and Instagram collects money for providing that
				data. Now, if person A is paying person B for something, that’s
				a sale. So is Instagram not selling your data? And, are you
				compensated for it fairly?
			</p>
			<p>
				Privacy Policy is a ridiculously boring read, and it’s
				unrealistic to expect that people will read these documents each
				time they sign up for a new site. But it is important that
				companies be honest with people about what exactly they know
				about them and how they are using that knowledge. And we should
				expect our governments to regulate this. In the meantime it is
				important for us, as users, to stay vigilant.
