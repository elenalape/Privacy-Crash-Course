			<h4>Transcript</h4>
			<p>I have a confession to make. I committed a crime.</p>

			<p>
				It was a really boring day at work and I wanted to have some
				fun. I knew that my friend, Ben, was just about to graduate and
				was waiting on some exam results.
			</p>

			<p>
				So I crafted an email, pretending to be the university
				department that is responsible for grades. I asked him to send
				the university a photo of his passport, quite urgently, because
				we’re having issues confirming his identity.
			</p>

			<p>
				A few minutes later, Ben sends me his passport picture. So I
				called him.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course, we’re friends, I’m not going to do anything terrible
				with it besides maybe giggle at his hilarious passport photo,
				but it could have totally been a criminal who wanted to take out
				a loan on Ben’s behalf.
			</p>

			<p>
				Due to security concerns, I’m not able to show you how exactly I
				did this, but this technique of sending emails from a made up
				email address is called <strong>spoofing</strong>.
			</p>

			<p>It’s a phishing technique. But what’s phishing?</p>

			<p>
				Phishing is the art of someone pretending to be someone else to
				get things out of you. It’s illegal: it’s a crime. For example:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					someone pretending to be your bank to get to tell them your
					card number
				</li>
				<li>
					someone posing as an Amazon employee to get you give them
					your account information
				</li>
				<li>
					a user messaging you "on behalf of" Instagram support to get
					you to give them your password, or your account will
					disappear
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The idea of a phish is to create an email or a message that
				looks like the real deal, so that you trust the sender, and
				trust opening any links or attachments they send you, or answer
				their questions.
			</p>
			<p>So how do we spot a phishing email?</p>
			<p>Below are some tips to spot a potential phish.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Regognise an odd sender, where the email address doesn't
					look quite right e.g. yourschool@gmail.com. However, email
					addresses can be spoofed, so don't blindly trust the sender
					if any of the following are also true.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you didn’t expect to get that email or message, like a
					bill for a service you never used, it could be a phishing
					attempt.
				</li>
				<li>
					Check if the organisation sent something similar in the
					past. Formatting, links in the message. If it looks totally
					different, be cautious.
				</li>
				<li>Phishes often have poor grammar and spelling.</li>
				<li>
					Mismatched URLs could be another giveaway. If the email
					comes as on behalf of Facebook, but the link inside the
					message asks you to visit some other site or send an email
					that isn't facebook.com, it is likely to be a phish.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Cool! But, what if you already clicked on a link in the message?
				Is there anything you can do? (Yes, sometimes)
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Check the URL at the top of the page. Does it look like the
					sender?
				</li>
				<li>
					Be cautious of login forms that ask you to submit your data.
					Banks, for example, will rarely link a login link directly
					in the email. Instead, they ask you to go on their wesbite
					yourself.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				As we saw at the beginning, successfully pretending to be
				someone else is actually not that hard. Ben is a software
				engineer with years of experience, yet still fell for the trap.
			</p>

			<p>
				Usually, for high volumes of emails, our phishing detection
				algorithms get better, attackers are also getting
				increasingly... smart.
			</p>

			<p>
				We forget what information we put out through social media. It
				is totally possible that someone can call you, pretending to be
				a friend you met at an event that you posted about, or reference
				your birthday and home city.
			</p>

			<p>
				Phishing is much more about people than it is about technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, I hope that using the tips you learned throughout this
				video, you will be able to protect yourself and those around you
