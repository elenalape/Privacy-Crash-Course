# Privacy Crash Course

Check it out yourself: https://mypasswordispassword.club

A website and video content for 13+ year olds to learn about internet security and privacy. The videos are linked on the site, and can also be found on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/elenalape).

Each topic is split into a lesson. Each lesson contains a video, a brief summary of the key points and a full video transcript. There is also a link to a quiz to test your skills.

### Hacking Passwords

The topic explores how the passwords are stored in a database (spoiler: they're hashed), and how they may be decoded. We also look into what makes a good password.

### Terms and Conditions & Privacy Policy

Very few people on the planet read the contents of the two whenever they sign up for a new website. The topic gives a summary of what each document and analyses Instagram's Data Policy as a case study.

### How I Phished My Brother (Coming soon)

I wrote a script to send out emails from whatever address I want. Due to security concerns, we can't look at the script, but we'll look at some creative phishing emails and scams.
